****AI - Machine Learning Regression : Prediction Students’ Score based on Number of Hours Studied****
**PROJECT OVERVIEW**

Through this project, we are allowed to predict students’ scores (as y label) based on their study hours. This prediction is using three Machine Learning model  : 
 1. Linear Regression
 2. Decision Tree
 3. Random Forest

By using those model, we will find out the best model for our dataset which consists of students’ scores and study hours. 

**Requirements**

- Version of Pandas : 2.0.3
- Version of matplotlib : 3.7.1
- Version of seaborn : 0.13.1
- Version of numpy : 1.25.2
